## Config files

### Dotfiles

```zsh
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/jesusabarca/.dotfiles.git
cd .dotfiles
rcup -v SpaceVim.d/ zshrc gitconfig gitignore_global
```
#### Update your name and email address on `~/.gitconfig`

## Ruby on Rails

#### Check the latest available versions of Ruby
```zsh
rbenv install --list | egrep "[^-.]2\.\d{1,2}\.\d{1,2}$" | tail
```
#### Install the latest Ruby version (ie 2.6.5), set it up as the default versionand install `rubocop`
```zsh
rbenv install 2.6.5
rbenv global 2.6.5
gem install rubocop
```
#### Verify Rbenv works properly
```zsh
